# spending_tracker

This is a simple spending tracker built using python and flask which allows users to create Merchants, Tags, and Transactions to keep track of their spending.

The transactions are shown with a spending total, and users can filter and sort their transactions by Merchant, Tag, amount, and date/time.

Before running the application, you should create a database called "transaction_manager" and run the file "transaction_manager.sql" on the database from your terminal.

To run, open terminal and enter: "flask run", then go to the displayed web address in your browser.
